The Orbit Framework
-------------------

**A Lightweight, Problem-First Methodology for Clarity and Predictable Product Delivery.**

The Orbit Framework is designed for software teams that are tired of ambiguity and "busywork." We provide a practical, systematic approach to ensure every line of code is written to solve a clearly articulated problem, transforming vague ideas into measurable, executable action.

### Why Orbit?

Traditional methodologies often focus too heavily on time and tasks, leading to bloated backlogs and missed deadlines due to unforeseen complexity. Orbit shifts the focus to **clarity** and **flow**:

*   **Problem-First:** No work begins until the core user problem is understood, articulated, and validated.
    
*   **Predictable Delivery:** We replace time-based estimates with an objective **Complexity Scoring Model** to manage and signal ambiguity before development starts.
    
*   **Shared Understanding:** The framework enforces collaboration between Product and Engineering, ensuring absolute alignment on the _What, When, and Depth_ of every decision.
